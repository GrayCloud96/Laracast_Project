## Laracasts project

Hello, everyone. My name is Fares Mounir Merzouk, a web developper and this is my first step of learning laravel web applications.
This is a tutorial I followed using Laracasts website. I learned how to build a Single Page Application with Laravel 4.2.8, blade php using XAMPP for Mysql database.
This application is a blog post SPA application that contains posts, their authors and categories. This is a good way to learn Laravel features and syntax. By following the videos, you'll learn how to code, make migrations to databases and creating relationships between DB tables. I did not go all along these videos but learned enough to start my study projects. Although, I recommand to all of you to reach out to <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/">Laravel 8 
from scratch</a> and see by yourself. Good luck and have fun.

To launch the application, you need to download the folder and put it in htdocs of XAMPP (or any server that has apache) and start the migration first with this command in the command line below (if the migration does not succeed, go to .env file and check the database configuration on it):

- **[php artisan migrate]

Then, you are good to go with:

- **[php artisan server]

and you go to 127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser, enjoy.
